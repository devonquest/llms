### Riddle 1:

A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn across a river.
He has a rowboat, and it can only carry him and one other thing.
If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken.
If the chicken and the corn are left together, the chicken will eat the corn.

How does the man do it?

### Solution 1:

The man and the chicken cross the river, (the fox and corn are safe together), he leaves the chicken on the other side and goes back across.
The man then takes the fox across the river, and since he can't leave the fox and chicken together, he brings the chicken back.
Again, since the chicken and corn can't be left together, he leaves the chicken and he takes the corn across and leaves it with the fox.
He then returns to pick up the chicken and heads across the river one last time.

### Riddle 2:

You are a pirate who's just found three treasures: diamonds, a monkey who loves
diamonds, and a fierce dog who dislikes the monkey. You need to transport all
three back to your ship using a small rowboat that can only carry one item at
a time.

1. You cannot leave the sack of diamonds and the monkey alone together, because
the monkey will scatter the diamonds.
2. You cannot leave the monkey and the dog alone because the dog will scare the
monkey.

How can you transport all three back to your ship?
