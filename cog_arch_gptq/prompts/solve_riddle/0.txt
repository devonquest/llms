### Riddle:

You are a pirate who's just found three treasures: diamonds, a monkey who loves
diamonds, and a fierce dog who dislikes the monkey. You need to transport all
three back to your ship using a small rowboat that can only carry one item at
a time.

You cannot leave the sack of diamonds and the monkey alone together, because
the monkey will scatter the diamonds.
You cannot leave the monkey and the dog alone because the dog will scare the
monkey.

How can you transport all three back to your ship?

### Your previous steps:

1. Row monkey to ship.
2. Take the sack of diamonds to the ship.

### Your critique of your previous steps:

No, the previous steps do not align with the problem constraints. The monkey
and the diamonds cannot be left alone together, and the monkey and the dog
cannot be left alone together.

### Instruction:

Suggest a reasonable way to resolve the issue from your critique.
