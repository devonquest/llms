Consider the following riddle:

"""
You are a pirate who's just found three treasures: a sack of diamonds, a monkey who loves diamonds, and a fierce dog who dislikes the monkey. You need to transport all three back to your ship using a small rowboat that can only carry one item at a time.

1. You cannot leave the sack of diamonds and the monkey alone together, because the monkey will scatter the diamonds.
2. You cannot leave the monkey and the dog alone because the dog will scare the monkey.

How can you transport all three back to your ship?
