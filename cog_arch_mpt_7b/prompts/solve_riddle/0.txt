### Instruction:

You are a pirate who's just found three treasures: diamonds, a monkey who loves diamonds, and a fierce dog who dislikes the monkey. You need to transport all three back to your ship using a small rowboat that can only carry one item at a time.

1. You cannot leave the sack of diamonds and the monkey alone together, because the monkey will scatter the diamonds.
2. You cannot leave the monkey and the dog alone because the dog will scare the monkey.

How can you transport all three back to your ship?

The desired end state is that all three items are safely back on your ship.
The main tool used to go from the initial to the desired end state is the pirate's rowboat.
The solution constraints are that the pirate must not leave the sack of diamonds and the monkey alone together, because the monkey will scatter the diamonds. The pirate must not leave the monkey and the dog alone because the dog will scare the monkey.
At each step, the main action involves the pirate using the rowboat to transport one item at a time to the ship.

The monkey is already on the ship.
The dog is already on the ship.

Explain why the proposed next step action "Bring diamonds to ship."
doesn't make sense.
