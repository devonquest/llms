### Riddle:

You are a pirate who's just found three treasures: diamonds, a monkey who loves
diamonds, and a fierce dog who dislikes the monkey. You need to transport all
three back to your ship using a small rowboat that can only carry one item at
a time.

1. You cannot leave the sack of diamonds and the monkey alone together, because
the monkey will scatter the diamonds.
2. You cannot leave the monkey and the dog alone because the dog will scare the
monkey.

How can you transport all three back to your ship?

### Proposed solution:

The solution is to put the monkey in the sack of diamonds, and the dog in the
monkey's pouch. Then you can put the sack of diamonds in the boat, and the
monkey and dog in the boat together.

### Solution critique:

The proposed solution is incorrect because the dog will still be able to
scare the monkey.

Based on the solution critique, how can we improve the solution?
