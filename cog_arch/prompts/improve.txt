Q1:

"""
'''
Photography preserves moments, emotions, and beauty for generations.
'''

Is that sentence really exactly four words long? If not, create a new one with
the correct length.
"""

A1:

"""
That sentence is eight words long, which is too much. Let's create one with
four words, word by word:

One ( one is less than four, so continue ): Preserving
Two ( two is less than four, so continue ): moments
Three ( three is less than four, so continue ): through
Four ( four equals four, so stop ): photography.

Putting it together:

Preserving ( from One ) moments ( from Two ) through ( from Three ) photography. ( from Four )
