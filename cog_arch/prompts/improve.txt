Q1:

"""
'''
Photography preserves moments, emotions, and beauty for generations.
'''

Is that sentence really exactly four words long? If not, correct it. Think
step by step as follows to get the correct result:

- set your count to 0
- start from the first word
- increment your count
- go to the next word
- increment your count
- repeat until last word
- if count = 4, then the result is correct
"""

A1:

"""
- Set your count to 0.
- Start from the first word, which is "Photography." Increment your count to 1.
- Go to the next word, which is "preserves." Increment your count to 2.
- Continue to the next word, "moments," and increment your count to 3.
- Move on to the next word, "emotions," and increment your count to 4.
- Finally, reach the last word, "and," and increment your count to 5.

Since the count is already 5, which is not equal to 4, the result is
not correct.

Correct result:

Preserving moments through photography.
